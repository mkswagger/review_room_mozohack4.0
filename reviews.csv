Good product üëç
I really like the quality of this product. Thanks!
Value for money
"We were earlier using aluminum foils by different companies, to wrap food etc. One day, I saw this product on Amazon and bought it, just for trying.These were recently manufactured, and I got two sets (100 sheets) for Rs. 198/-, as 2 was the minimum quantity.Sheets are fine, and provided brushes are good as well. Sheets are properly cut and easy to use. I ‚Äãthink that these are good alternative to aluminum foils, for wrapping the food items.But one does not want to pay for brushes every single time, as cost of those brushes would also be included. For that reason, I was looking for a similar product by some other company, but without brushes.I found and bought Vvaashi Butter Paper 200 sheets for around Rs. 250. Those are good as well. So, at Rs 1.25 per sheet, Vvaashi sheets are cheaper and better value for money."
"Thank you team ranur for the handwritten note, I have been using the butter paper sheets for quite some time now and they are very handy for storing chapatis. Thank you once again for the lovely note!!"
Good
